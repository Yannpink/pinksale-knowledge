# Whitelist Tiers

## Overview
This guide explains PinkSale's Whitelist Tiers system, which allows projects to create different allocation levels for presale participants.

## Setting Up Tiers
1. Select "Whitelist with Tier" option
2. Add additional tiers using "Add a Tier" button
3. Configure each tier:
   - Set tier number (Tier 1, 2, etc.)
   - Define end time for each tier
   - During each tier period, only wallets in that tier can contribute

## Managing Whitelist
1. Click "Add users to whitelist"
2. Select appropriate tier
3. Add wallet addresses for that tier
4. Repeat for each tier as needed

## Post-Whitelist Options
1. After all tier periods end
2. Navigate to whitelist settings
3. Enable Public Sale mode
4. Set public sale parameters
5. Save changes to allow general participation

## Important Notes
- Each tier operates sequentially
- Only whitelisted addresses can participate during their tier period
- Public sale can be enabled after all tier periods end
- Monitor tier end times to ensure smooth transitions
- Keep whitelist addresses backed up for reference
