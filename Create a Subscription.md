## Q&A

Q: How does a Subscription differ from a traditional presale?
A: While a Subscription pool shares similarities with a traditional presale, such as predetermined rates and listing rates, it introduces key differences that make it unique.

In a Subscription, the owner specifies the total number of tokens for sale and a soft cap, which is also represented by the selling tokens. Unlike traditional presales, there are no minimum or maximum contribution limitsâ€”users can commit any amount.

Additionally, at the end of the sale in a Subscription format, there will be a phase called the Calculation Phase, indicated by the "calculating" status on the website for that pool. During this phase, PinkSale determines whether the pool has successfully met the soft cap. If the soft cap is met, the system then calculates token allocations based on the total committed funds.

Each user has a maximum allocation cap. If a user commits an amount exceeding the tokens they are eligible to receive, the excess allocation is redistributed to other users who haven't reached their cap. In essence, the more a user commits, the higher their chance of securing the maximum allocation. Any remaining excess commitment is refunded to the user.
