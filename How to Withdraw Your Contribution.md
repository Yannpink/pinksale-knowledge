-   The presale must have either:
    -   Ended without reaching its soft cap, or
    -   Been officially canceled, either by the presale owner or by a PinkSale admin.

## Step 1: Initiate Withdrawal

1. Locate the presale you participated in
2. Click the "Withdraw Contribution" button

## Step 2: Confirm Transaction

1. Review the transaction in MetaMask
2. Check the transaction fee
3. Click "Confirm" to process the withdrawal

## Step 3: Verify Withdrawal

1. Wait for transaction confirmation
2. Check your wallet balance
3. Verify that your fund (BNB/ETH/SOL...depends on which chain the presale is on) has been returned

## Notes

-   Transaction fees will apply for the withdrawal process
-   Make sure you have enough native tokens to cover the gas fees
