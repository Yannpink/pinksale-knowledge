# Refund Types on PinkSale

When creating a Presale or Subscription pool on PinkSale, the refund type determines what happens to the unsold tokens after a successful fundraising (i.e., when the pool reaches the soft cap). There are two available options:

1. Burn

-   Any unsold tokens at the time of listing will be permanently burned (sent to a zero address and removed from circulation).
-   This helps reduce the total supply, potentially increasing the token's scarcity and value.
-   Ideal for projects aiming to prevent unsold tokens from being reintroduced into circulation.

2. Refund

-   Any unsold tokens will be returned to the pool owner after the sale ends.
-   The project owner can use these tokens for future marketing, staking, or redistribution.
-   Provides flexibility for the team to manage remaining tokens post-sale.
