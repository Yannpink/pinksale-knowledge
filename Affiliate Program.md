# Affiliate Program

## Overview

Project owners can enable the affiliate program before/after creating the presale pool. Affiliate program cannot be disabled after you enabled it. Only the project owner can set rewards for the affiliate program himself (max is 5% of hard-cap). Users participating in the affiliate program can claim rewards after the presale got finalized.

## Reward Calculation

Affiliate Reward Pool = Total Presale Raised \* % Referral

Total rewards will be shared for users who brought buy volume to the presale pool. The more buy volume you bring to the presale pool, the higher reward you will get.

### Example Calculation

If you set the affiliate pool is 5%, and the presale raised 1000 BNB. Affiliate Reward Pool = 1000 BNB x 5% = 50 BNB. If there are 3 users participating in the affiliate program:

-   A refers a user to buy 100 BNB
-   B refers a user to buy 60 BNB
-   C refers a user to buy 40 BNB

Total BNB referred = A + B + C = 200 BNB

Reward Distribution:

-   User A will receive 50% (100/200) of the affiliate reward pool = 25 BNB
-   User B will receive 30% (60/200) of the affiliate reward pool = 15 BNB
-   User C will receive 20% (40/200) of the affiliate reward pool = 10 BNB

## Q&A

Q: What happens if I refer people, but the presale gets canceled?
A: If the presale cannot be finalized, you won’t receive any affiliation rewards for that pool since the people you referred will be able to reclaim their contributions.

Q: Do I need to claim my rewards immediately after the pool finalizes?
A: No, you can claim your rewards anytime by visiting your profile at https://www.pinksale.finance/me.

Q: Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?
A: No, there’s no limit to the number of people you can refer. However, there is a cap on the total rewards for the pool, which can be set by the pool owner. Your referral rewards will be based on the total contribution made by your referrals.
