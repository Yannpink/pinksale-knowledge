## Q&A

Q: The pool has ended, but I can't finalize it. Why?
A: When a subscription pool ends, PinkSale needs to perform calculations to determine the total raised funds and allocate contributions accordingly. This process usually takes only a few minutes. If it's taking too long, contact PinkSale administrators for assistance.

Q: What happens if PinkSale completes the calculations, but the owner doesnâ€™t list it immediately?
A: Once the calculations are finished, the next steps depend on the fundraising result:

-   If the pool is successful (exceeds the soft cap), contributors can withdraw any excess funds based on their allocation.
-   If the pool fails (does not reach the soft cap), contributors can withdraw their full contribution amount.

Q: When can I withdraw my excess commitment funds?
A: Once PinkSale completes the calculations, if the pool meets its soft cap, you can withdraw your excess commitment immediately. Alternatively, you can wait for the owner to list the token and then withdraw the excess funds along with claiming your tokens in a single transaction. If the pool fails to reach the soft cap, you will be able to withdraw your entire committed amount.
