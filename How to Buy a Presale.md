## Q&A

Q: What's the difference between "contribute" and "buy"?
A: Both are the same and can be used interchangeably.

Q: I can't contribute to this presale although it is still in progress?
A: There are several reasons you might not be able to contribute to an in progress presale:

-   The presale might have reached its designated hard cap. In this case, you can no longer contribute to it.
-   The owner has enabled the whitelist function. In this case, you can contact them (e.g in their social media/Telegram) to get a whitelist slot so you can contribute.

Q: I accidentally contributed/bought the wrong presale. What option do I have?
A: If the presale hasn't ended yet, you can try using the Emergency withdraw function. If it has already ended, please take a look at the Withdraw contribution function.

Q: I have more BNB/ETH/SOL available, but I can only buy a small amount. Why?
A: The presale owner may have set a maximum contribution limit. If that's the case, you won't be able to buy more than the allowed amount.

Q: The presale has reached the soft cap, but there's no hard cap, and people can still buy. The progress keeps increasing. Is this a bug?
A: No, it's not a bug. This is a type of presale called a Fair Launch. In a Fair Launch, there's no global maximum contribution limit, so people can continue buying as much as they want. The presale will only be considered successful if the total contributions exceed the soft cap.
