# Manual Listing

## Overview
This guide explains how to manually list your token on DEX after a successful presale on PinkSale.

## For Project Owners
Manual listing means project owners will have to list their token on DEX themself after the pool ends. Token won't be automatically listed on DEX by PinkSale after the project owner finalizes the pool.

## For Investors 
Manual listing means investors will receive tokens after the project owner finalizes the pool but they will have to wait until the project owner adds liquidity for the project on DEX to buy/sell those tokens.
