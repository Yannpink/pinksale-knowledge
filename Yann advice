Difference between presale launch and fair launch:
In a presale you put an amount of tokens to sell for a set price - example 1000 tokens per bnb.  You have a soft cap and a hard cap, depending on how much BNB that is, every user gets tokens at a fixed price per BNB. You cannot exceed HC limit since price is already fixed per token. 
Fair launch - you pick a soft cap but no hard cap, if you pass the softcap you can raise as much BNB as you can, after it is finalized depending on how much BNB is raised you get the price. You don't know the price before fair launch is finalized. Then price of the tokens comes as Price = BNB / Tokens
You can end the fair launch any time after softcap is met. 
What to remember: Fair Launch doesn't have - Hard Cap, Vesting.  difference between presale and listing price. Price is calculated tokens for sale / funds raised. Everyone gets the same end price. 
You can change the start / end date of the Fairlaunch only before it start, after start cannot be extended, you can only stop it after reaching softcap.

Trending has 2 phases:

Before sale starts - here the badges help the most - Dox, KYC, audit, Safu.  Each badge gives you multiplier to the trending score, thus with kyc / audt you can trend before sale has started

Once sale starts - the badges again act as multiplier, but the rest of the score is made from the volume + time till end of sale. The close to end the more trending it gets
