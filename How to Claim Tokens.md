# How to Claim Tokens

## Overview

This guide explains the process of claiming tokens after participating in a presale, including prerequisites and step-by-step instructions.

## Prerequisites

-   Must have participated in presale and purchased tokens
-   Presale must have reached soft cap or hard cap
-   Pool must be finalized by owner in case it is an auto listing pool. For manual listing pool, the claim time must be set by the owner.

## Step 1: Claiming Process

1. Wait for "Claim X token" button to become available on the specific presale page, where X corresponds to the tokens allocated to you.
2. Click "Claim X token" button.
3. Check the necessary gas fee and click confirm transaction in MetaMask/Phantom or your chosen wallet.

## Step 2: Post-Claim Steps

1. Check wallet balance for received tokens (you might need to manually add the token address to your wallet).
2. Follow project's social media channels for updates.

## Important Notes

-   Claiming only possible after pool finalization for auto listing presale, and after claim time has been set for manual listing presale.
-   Gas fees required for claim transaction
-   Claimable amount will be shown inside the claim button.

## Q&A

Q: Why is the claim button disabled/not showing up for me?
A: Make sure you have contributed in said presale, and that presale at least reaches the soft cap, and the owner have enabled the claiming by finalization or setting claim time.

Q: Claim transaction failed.
A: There are numerous reasons why the claim transaction might be failed:

-   You might have already claimed the tokens.
-   The owner have not enabled claiming yet.
-   The gas fee you paid is too low so your transaction is dropped after some time.

For other reasons, please send us the transaction hash so we can manually verify.

Q: I claimed the tokens, but it does not show up in my wallet.
A: For custom tokens, they might not be automatically show up in the wallet. For more information, please refer to the following guide on how to add the token to Metamask: https://support.metamask.io/manage-crypto/tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask/#how-to-add-a-custom-token

Q: I contributed to a presale, but after it ended the withdraw button is shown. What should I do?
A: The presale is probably cancelled by the owner, either because it didn't reach the soft cap or for the other reasons. In this case, you can click the withdraw button to get back your contributed tokens.

Q: The pool has been finalized, but I still can't see the claim button.
A: It may be a manual listing pool, so you'll need to wait for the owner to set the claim time. Once the set time has passed, you'll be able to claim.
